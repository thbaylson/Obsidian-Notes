p11 - He is known as the Platinum Dragon. Is the patron and progenitor of metallic dragons. Adventurers and dragons alike pray to Bahamut to uphold honor and justice, or when they need courage to face a great threat. He seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of [[Tiamat]] the Dragon Queen and the evil dragons that serve her.
