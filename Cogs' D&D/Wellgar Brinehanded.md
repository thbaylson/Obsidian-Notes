Cleric at the [[Temple of Procan]]. An old man.

Shared a little bit of knowledge about The Mansion. It's a landmark of the town, but one that people fear. No one goes near that mansion. No one knew the wizard's name, he was simply known as "[[The Alchemist]]".

"It's hard to discern what is real and what is superstition. The people of this town have been known to make a mountain out of a molehill."

"Supplies used to be requested by the wizard to be dropped off at the mansion. But those requests have stopped. No supplies have been dropped off and nobody has seen the wizard since before I was a boy."

"I've tried to peer into the house with divination, but have been unsuccessful each time."
