A younger man with a sharp angular face. Belongs to the [[Saltmarsh Council]]. Inherited a fishery after his mother died. It is the longest fishery in Saltmarsh. He clearly loves this town and wants to serve its people.

"The people here are very superstitious. It's hard to piece out the truth. But there used to be an old Alchemist Wizard fellow. Around 80 years ago he died. His mansion is still there. And travels have seen flashes of light and heard voices coming from the mansion."

Smokes: Is there anyone alive who remembers the previous owner of the mansion?
Anders: Yes, though the previous owner was very secretive. He hardly ever interacted with the citizens of Saltmarsh. Ferrin Kastilar is a nearby druid, lives out in the old seagrove, he may know more. There's also a temple to the sea god to the North. There's a cleric of the Temple of Procan, Wellgar Brinehanded, he may remember the old Wizard.
