Procan is an ancient, primal god. He is wild and tempestuous; he can be benevolent or malevolent at turns, but generally cares nothing for humanity unless carefully propitiated - and perhaps not even then. He's the embodiment of mercurial winds and uncertain fate. He is greedy and possessive of the wealth that comes to his domain, whether from deliberate offerings or sunken ships. He's an elder god, almost like a titan, though he roams the cosmos freely.

Procan's Trident is rumored to be housed in this temple.

Portrayals: Muscular man with blue-green skin and hair. His eyes are golden, glinting like sunken treasure. He carries a large spear dripping with seaweed.
Iconography: His symbol is a trident w/ seaweed hanging off of it.
