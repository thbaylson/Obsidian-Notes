The ten biggest lessons Mark Brown learned from the last decade of learning about game design. Each lesson is accompanied by related videos by GMTK.
## 1: A game is its [[Game Mechanics|mechanics]]
If you want to understand why a game makes you feel a certain way, ask yourself: how do the mechanics contribute to the experience?

## 2: The right mechanics to use depends on the experience
The only was to judge a mechanic is to ask whether or not is can contribute to the experience you're trying to forge.

There's no such thing as a right or wrong game mechanic. It depends entirely on the kind of experience you want your players to have.

## 3: Know your audience
When it comes to making a video game, you have to decide who this game is for, and tune your mechanics appropriately. You can't please everyone..... right?

## 4: Difficulty is relative to necessity
Well, maybe you can?
Options and bonus content can be used to make a game appealing to those who are more hardcore than the target audience.

## 5: Games should be accessible
Options, accessibility settings, and easy modes don't have to pose a threat to your intended experience. You just have to find a smart way to push players into seeing the version of the game that fits their needs best.

## 6: Don't get hung up on genres
Designers should think of genres in the loosest possible terms.

## 7: Keep it simple
The best solution for a complex problem is whatever provides the most interesting experience to the player.

The point of AI (in games) is not to pass the Turing Test, but to provide interesting gameplay. Give players a *specific* experience.

## 8: Ideas are cheap
A game idea is worthless until you've proven its value through a prototype.

It's easy to think a game idea would be fun in theory, but we won't know for sure until it's tested.

## 9: Playtest, playtest, playtest
Frequent playtesting should be used to make sure your design is effectively producing the results you desire.

Game design is about building a game for *other* people. Part of a designer's job is to find solutions to problems that come up through playtesting. Maciej Binkowski, lead designer of [Dying Light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dying_Light), recommends designers step back and consider the root cause of a problem before trying to patch up the problem being complained about ([ref](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXRMUBjQErI)).

This is the best way to figure out a game's balance.

How to fix problems that come up in playtesting:
* Quickly iterate through possible solutions (eg: [Diablo 3's Team](https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1017794/Through-the-Grinder-Refining-Diablo))
* Identify the levers (eg: [Halo 3's Team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YJ53skc-k4))
* Make BIG changes (eg: [Sid Meier](https://www.pcgamesn.com/sid-meiers-memoir-civilization))
* Flip it on its head (eg: [Shovel Knight's Team](https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/check-point-design/))
* Find the solution elsewhere (eg: [Last of Us's Team](https://kotaku.com/how-we-made-the-last-of-uss-interface-work-so-well-1571841317))
* Solve multiple issues at once (eg: [NSMB's Team](https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-New-Super-Mario-Bros-Wii/Volume-3/1-Solving-Multiple-Problems-with-Bubbles/1-Solving-Multiple-Problems-with-Bubbles-219417.html))
* Study player behavior (eg: [Gears of War's Team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73Pqsk74Jc0))

## 10: Self Evaluate
Always figure out for yourself if a game design lesson is true for you, and for the type of games you want to make.

Every lesson needs to be constantly reevaluated. Never take someone else's opinion on game design as gospel.
