What is Cognitive Accessibility?
* Reducing or removing cognitive barriers between players and games.
* Design or features that enable players to comprehend the information presented to them so that they can make informed decisions.

Examples of Cognitive Accessibility:
* Manual saves at any time.
* Easy to understand subtitles.
* Reduce the effects of light and motion sickness.
* Disable distracting animations from UI/UX.
* Always available training area. Allow players to practice sufficiently unique mechanics at any time. Example: Jedi Survivor.
* Content warning. Give an explicit and timely warning to content that may be triggering for some individuals. Example: Dead Space.
* Navigation assistance.
* Controls guides.
* Persistent on screen prompts.
* Presenting information in a varied and modular way.

Accessibility features should not be a last minute consideration. They should be worked into the planning and development cycles of the game. This also allows for 'accessibility by design', which is to have accessibility features be, or feel like they belong aside, core game mechanics.
