Ch I-1
"The Purelake extended in all directions, hundreds of miles wide, its glassy surface perfectly transparent. At its deepest, it was never more than six feet from shimmering surface to the bottom - and in most places, the worm, slow-moving water came up only to about midcalf. It was filled with tiny fish, colorful cremlings, and eel-like riverspren."

Once considered part of [[Cosmere/Planetary Systems/The Rosharan System/Roshar/Places/Roshar#History#The Silver Kingdoms Epoch#Nations|Selas Tales]].

Nu Ralik and Vun Makak are names deified by the Purelakers. "Foreigners were so stupid. Of course Nu Ralik was their god, but always *pretended* that he wasn't. Vun Makak - his younger, spireful brother - had to be tricked into thinking you worshipped him, otherwise he'd get jealous. It was only safe to speak of these things in a holy gotto." - [[Ishikk]]
