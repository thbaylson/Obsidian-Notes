Ch 54 Gibletish:
[[Dalinar Kholin|Dalinar]] is talking to Wit-

"I know," Wit said, then looked directly at him. "[[Adonalsium]]." 
Dalinar frowned more deeply. "What?" 
Wit searched his face. "Have you ever heard the term, Dalinar?" 
"Ado... what?" 
"Nothing," Wit said. He seemed preoccupied, unlike his usual self.
...
".. like a Dysian Aimian. If you do put a man together like that, Dalinar, be sure to name him Gibberish, after me. Or perhaps Gibletish."
"Is that your name, then? Your real name?"
"No, my friend," Wit said, standing up. "I've abandoned my real name. But when next we meet, I'll think of a clever one for you to call me. Until then, Wit will suffice- or if you must, you may call me Hoid. Watch yourself; Sadeas is planning a revelation at the feast tonight, though I know not what it is. Farewell. I'm sorry I didn't insult you more."
