One of the [[Shard]] in the Mistborn Series. [[Allomancy]] comes from Preservation. 

Throughout *"The Well of Ascension"* and *"The Hero of Ages"* he appears as the mist spirit.

He is eventually killed by [[Ruin]]. For a short period of time, [[Vin]] inherits his powers. Afterwards, [[Sazed]] seizes them and becomes [[The Hero of Ages]].

Preservation left clues and patterns in nature that hinted towards his existence. The number 16 is strongly associated with Preservation. #Theorycraft Preservation is the Sixteenth Shard.
