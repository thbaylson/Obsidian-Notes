Also known as "Shards of [[Adonalsium]]." There are 16 (actually 17) in total.

These beings are powerful. They are very often revered as gods by any sentient species that interacts with them.

Known Shards
- [[Honor]]
- [[Cultivation]]
- [[Odium]]
- [[Preservation]]
- [[Ruin]]
- [[Dominion]]
- [[Devotion]]


### #Theorycraft
Possible Gods
- [[Harmony]]
- [[Hope]]
- [[Passion]]

These beings are worshipped, but it's unclear if they are Shards:
- [[Austre]]
- [[Domi]] (Possibly Dominion?)
- [[Jesker]]

I believe the Shards listed here may be more specifically called first degree Shards. They're direct splinters of Adonalsium. I think these Shards can splinter further to create Spren and Ceons, which might be considered second degree Shards. So called Shardblades and Shardplate may also be second degree shards, but in the Physical Realm.
