One of the [[Shard|Shards]] in the Mistborn series. 

Somehow [[Kwaan]] learns that Ruin is trapped within the [[Well of Ascension]]. Ruin has the ability to change written text that is not written in steel (one of the [[Allomantic Metals]]). It can also change information stored within [[Metalmind]]s. Ruin changes written prophecies in order to set up [[Alendi]] as [[The Hero of Ages]]. The prophecy says that The Hero must not take the power for himself, but instead give it up. Kwaan knows Alendi is a good man and thus likely to give up the power. Thus, he sends his nephew [[Rashek]] to prevent Alendi from completing his task.

Almost a thousand years later, [[Vin]] finds herself at the [[Well of Ascension]] after being guided by a mysterious mist spirit. We later learn that this spirit is likely [[Preservation]]. The spirit fatally wounds [[Elend Venture]] presumably to coax Vin into taking the power for herself to save him. However, she believes the prophecies about [[The Hero of Ages]] giving up the power for the greater good, thus accidentally releasing [[Ruin]].

Ruin has the ability to control [[Inquisitors]]. [[Marsh]] discovers that even though his actions are controlled, the contents of his mind remain his own.

[[Hemalurgy]] comes from Ruin. Because of this, he is able to control the [[Inquisitors]], the [[Kandra]], and the [[Koloss]].

[[Allomantic Metals#Atium|Atium]] is the physical manifestation of Ruin's body.
