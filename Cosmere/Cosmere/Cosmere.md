The universe. It is made up of systems of planets. Some inhabited planets do not have a Shard residing there. Each planet seems to have access to its own kind of [[Investiture]]. Travel among the planets (at least on the physical realm) is dependent on the [[Perpendicularities]].

## #Theorycraft
The [[Cosmere]] has a number of [[Shard]]s. These Gods must follow certain consequences, which define what they can and cannot do. This is a natural phenomenon, just like how "if you drop a rock, then as a consequence it will fall to the ground." (Why is this quoted? Where did it come from?)
