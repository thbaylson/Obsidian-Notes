A form of [[Investiture]].

An [[Elantris|Elantrian]] can draw [[Aons]] in the air with their fingers to access the power of the [[Dor]].
Aons are linked to the land. "To start, you draw [[Arelon]]... A line at the top for the coast, a line down the side for the mountains, and a dot in the middle for the lake." -Sirini, Chapter 46.

Since the [[Reod]], drawing an Aon causes it to flash once before fading away to nothing.

Chapter 49- [[Raoden]] and [[Galladan]] unlock the secrets of AonDor once again. The earthquake from the Reod created a chasm that permanently changed the face of [[Arelon]], thus causing any Aon drawn to require a new marking.
