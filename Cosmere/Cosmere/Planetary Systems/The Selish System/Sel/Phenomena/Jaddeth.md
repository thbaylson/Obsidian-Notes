Revered as one of the [[Shard]] on [[Sel]].

"Modern versions of the poem make reference to Jadeth in an almost [[Shu-Dereth|Derethi]] way. The version in this book shows that the priests rewrote the literature from the original to make it sound as if [[Wyrn]] were Derethi. Even though he lived long before [[Shu-Dereth]] was founded. Back then Jadeth - or at least the god of the same name that Shu-Dereth adopted - was **a relatively unimportant god who cared for the rocks under the earth**. Now that [[Fjorden]] is religious, they can't have it sounding like their greatest historical king was a pagan."- Sirini, in regards to [[Fjorden's Changed History]], Chapter 43.
