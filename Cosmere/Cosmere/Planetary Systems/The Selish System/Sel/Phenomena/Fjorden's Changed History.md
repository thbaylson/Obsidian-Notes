"For the last 300 years, ever since [[Fjorden]] adopted the [[Shu-Dereth|Derethi]] religion, the Wyrns have been blatantly altering their countries own histories and literature. To make it seem as if the empire has always been a manifestation of divine purpose." - Sirini, according to an original copy of Wyrn written by Seor, Chapter 43.
