Self aware [[Splinters of Investiture]].

A race of beings whose physical representation is a single, levitating, glowing Aon. The appear to pulse rhythmically when they talk. They can communicate amongst themselves telepathically regardless of distance. 

Each individual Seon is bound to their own human. Seon's seem obsessively compelled to serve.

If a human is taken by the [[Shaod]], then their Seon becomes a mindless husk of their former self. Their light dims, they become non-communicative, and they appear to wander aimlessly. This seems to give evidence to a spiritual bond between a human and their Seon.

Do Seons come from [[The Cognitive Realm]]?
