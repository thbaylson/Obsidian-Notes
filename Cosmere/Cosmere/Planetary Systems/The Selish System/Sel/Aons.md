A symbolic language used by the [[Elantris|Elantrian]]s. Used in the practice of [[AonDor]].

Every Aon starts with three strokes: "A line across the top, a line down the side, and a dot in the middle" -Chapter 46

Aons (IDK how these should be spelt, so I'm writing them based on how they sound):
"E-Hee" (Aon modifier -Chapter 46)
"Dye-o"
"Ray-o" (Probably "Rao" as in "Raoden")
