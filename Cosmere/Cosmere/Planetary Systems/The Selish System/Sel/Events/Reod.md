The event that brought about the [[Shaod]].

A massive earthquake took place in [[Arelon]]. This earthquake opened up a massive chasm, permanently changing the very shape of [[Arelon]]. This is what caused [[AonDor]] to stop working. The magical art depended on the user to draw representations of Arelon, but with the addition of the chasm, each and every Aon drawn prior was immediately rendered void. Because none of them had a mark to represent the chasm, they all immediately failed and faded.
