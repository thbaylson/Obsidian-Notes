Prince Raoden of [[Arelon]].

[[Iadan]]'s son.
[[Sarene]]'s husband.

Blessed/Cursed by the [[Shaod]].

After being thrown into [[Elantris]], he takes on the name Spirit.

After finding [[Galladan]]'s hidden library, he becomes obsessed with [[AonDor]]. He urges Galadon and Kurani to learn [[Aons]].

After practicing AonDor for weeks, his body started to change. Sometimes he will glow and experience an intense wave of pain. Eventually, it passes and he returns to normal. He believes the power of the [[Dor]] is trying to escape into the world through his body.

Raoden has a theory that the Shaod is some incomplete transformation. He bases his theory off of a medical account of an Elantrian doctor making a small error while practicing AonDor. The Elantrian was trying to heal a sick woman, but his Aons were drawn slightly incorrectly and ended up cursing the woman instead.
