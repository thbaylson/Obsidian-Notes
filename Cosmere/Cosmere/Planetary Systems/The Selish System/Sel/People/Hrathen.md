A [[Shu-Dereth|Derethi]] Gyorn from [[Fjorden]]. Given orders by Wyrn himself to bring [[Shu-Dereth]] to [[Arelon]].
Trained in a secret Derethi monastery.

He has his own [[Seon]] which he uses for direct communication with Wyrn.

He is a man of logic and pragmatism. All of his decisions seem to be based in logic.

He is almost always seen wearing a suit of armor. It's described by others as being too big to be comfortable, but Hrathen never seems to mind it. #Theorycraft Could this be Shard Plate?

Worked closely with [[Telrii]] to put him in a position of power. Hrathen's intention was to convert as much of Arelon's upperclass to Shu-Dereth as possible.

Poisoned himself to trick everyone into thinking he was taken by the [[Shaod]]. After the poison wore off, he claimed it was his faith in [[Jaddeth]] that cured him.

Poisoned [[Sarene]] to trick everyone into thinking she was taken by the Shaod. King [[Eventeo]] promises Hrathen that he'll convert to Shu-Dereth if Hrathen can heal his daughter. - Chapter 45.

"Time moves like a mountain... it will crush those who don't move before it." -Hrathen, Chapter 47. This is suspiciously close to a quote Wit gives.

Used to be a devout believer in Jadeth, but has recently found himself doubting.
