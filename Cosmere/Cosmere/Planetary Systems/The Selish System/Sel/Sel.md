There are three distinct kingdoms that all mostly try to ignore the others' existences. The planet has attracted two separate [[Shard|Shards of Adonalsium]]: [[Dominion]] and [[Devotion]]. "... at some point in the distant past, both Dominion and Devotion were destroyed. Their [[Investiture]], their power, was splintered. Their minds ripped away, their souls sent into The Beyond. ... At this point the bulk of the Investiture that made up the powers of Dominion and Devotion is trapped on [[The Cognitive Realm]]. Collectively, these powers which have a polarized relationship are called the [[Dor]]. â€¦ The rules of perception and intent are greatly magnified on Sel. ... I believe that the very landscape itself has become Invested to the point that it has a growing self-awareness." - [[The Universities of Silverlight]].


The only known inhabited planet in [[The Selish System]].
