Old friend, I hope this missive finds you well. Though, as you are now essentially immortal, I would guess that wellness on your part is something of a given. I realize that you are probably still angry. That is pleasant to know. Much as your perpetual health, I have come to rely upon your dissatisfaction with me. It is one of the [[Cosmere]]'s great constants, I should think. Let me first assure you that the element is quite safe. I have found a good home for it. I protect its safety like I protect my own skin, you might say. You do not agree with my quest. I understand that, so much as it is possible to understand someone with whom I disagree so completely. Might I be quite frank? Before, you asked why I was so concerned. It is for the following reasons:

* [[Ati]] was once a kind and generous man, and you saw what became of him. [[Rayse]], on the other hand, was among the most loathsome, crafty, and dangerous individuals I had ever met.
* He holds the most frightening and terrible of all of the [[Shard|Shards]]. Ponder on that for a time, you old reptile, and tell me if you insistence on nonintervention holds firm. Because I assure you, [[Rayse]] will not be similarly inhibited.
* One need only look at the aftermath of his brief visit to [[Sel]] to see proof of what I say. In case you have turned a blind eye to that disaster, know that [[Aona]] and [[Skai]] are both dead, and that which they held has been [[Splintered]]. Presumably to prevent anyone from rising up to challenge [[Rayse]].

You have accused me of arrogance in my quest. You have accused me of perpetuating my grudge against [[Rayse]] and [[Bavadin]]. Both accusations are true. Neither point makes the things I have written to you here untrue.

I am being chased. Your friends of the [[Seventeenth Shard]], I suspect. I believe they're still lost, following a false trail I left for them. They'll be happier that way. I doubt they have any inkling what to do with me should they actually catch me. If anything I have said makes a glimmer of sense to you, I trust that you'll call them off. Or maybe you could astound me and ask them to do something productive for once. For I have never been dedicated to a more important purpose, and the very pillars of the sky will shake with the results of our war here. I ask again. Support me. Do not stand aside and let disaster consume more lives. I've never begged you for something before, old friend.
I do so now.
