Ancient home of the [[Knights Radiant]]s. 

Chapter 32 -
"They lived high atop a place no man could reach, but all could visit. The tower city itself, crafted by the hands of no man."
\- Though *The Song of the Last Summer* is a fanciful tale of romance from the third century after the [[Recreance]], it is likely a valid reference in this case. See page 27 of [[Varala]]'s translation, and note the undertext.

 Chapter 34 -
 "I walked from [[Abamabar]] to Urithiru"
 \- This quote from the *Eighth Parable* of *[[The Way of Kings]]* seems to contradict [[Varala]] and [[Sinbin]], who both claim the city was inaccessible by foot. Perhaps there was a way constructed, or perhaps [[Nohadon]] was being metaphorical.


Chapter 35 -
"Though many wished Urithiru to be built in [[Alethkar|Alethela]], it was obvious that it could not be. And so it was that we asked for it to be placed westward, in the place nearest to [[Honor]]." 
\- Perhaps the oldest surviving original source mentioning the city, requited in *The Vavibrar*, line 1804. What I wouldn't give for a way to translate the [[Dawnchant]].
