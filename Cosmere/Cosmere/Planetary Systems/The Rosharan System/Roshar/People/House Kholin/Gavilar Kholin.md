Once, he was the King of [[Alethkar]]. Brother to [[Dalinar Kholin]]. A devout follower of [[Vorinism]]. Now, he is dead.

Strong features. Square chin, black beard flecked with white, striking pale green eyes.

A full Shardbearer. His Shardplate was a beautiful blue. His Shardblade was six feet long with a design along the blade like burning flames.

Gavilar's words to [[Szeth-son-son-Vallano]] moments before death:
"You can tell Thaidakar that he's too late." Gavilar seems to think Thaidakar is who sent the assassin. He then asks about Restares or Sadeas. Finally Szeth tells Gavilar it was the Parshendi.

Before dying, Gavilar gives Szeth a small crystalline sphere tied to a chain. The sphere was unlike any Szeth had seen. It was completely dark and seemed to glow with a light that was black.

Gavilar's dying words:
"Tell my brother he must find the most important words a man can say."
