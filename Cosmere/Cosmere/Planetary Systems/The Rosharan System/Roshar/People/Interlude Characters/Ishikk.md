A [[The Purelake|Purelaker]].

Ch I-1
Ishikk meets with three foreigners who are trying to track down [[Hoid]], which they refer to as Roamer. Which they describe has having white hair, clever tongue, and arrowlike face. They also remark that he has been known to dye his hair and wear disguises. Ishikk calls them Grump, Blunt, and Thinker. 
* Grump- Says his name is Temoo. Dark-skinned, thick-limbed, and completely bald. Often ends his sentences with 'friend.' On his way out he utters, "*Alavanta kamaloo kayana*." #Theorycraft His features and mannerisms are very similar to [[Galladan]]'s.

* Blunt- Says his name is Vao. Dark-skinned, taller, short dark hair, lean muscles, and broad shoulders. Stiff, with the build and air of a soldier.

* Thinker- We never hear his name. Light tan skin, like an Alethi. His eyes were the wrong shape to be Alethi and he didn't have the right accent. He doesn't talk much and he has a scar across his scalp.
