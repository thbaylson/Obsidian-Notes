About 19 years old at the start of the first book. Tall, with black [[Alethkar|Alethi]] hair and dark brown eyes.

Once a squadleader in [[Amaram]]'s army.

During one fateful skirmish, a shardbearer who wasn't supposed to be there kills most of Kaladin's squad. We overhear Amaram talking to someone who says the shardbearer was Veden and most likely working with the Ghostbloods. We later learn that this is [[Shallan Devar|Shallan]]'s brother.

8 Months Later.

Kaladin is branded as a slave. He rides in a wagon with 9 other slaves through the Unclaimed Hills. This would be the tenth group of slaves Kaladin has been in.

"They were all dead. Cenn and Dallet, and before that Tukks and the Takers. Before that, Tien. Before that, blood on his hands and the corpse of a young girl with pale skin." (The girl he failed to save?).

Leader of [[Bridge Four]], one of [[Sadeas]]' bridgecrews.

"CHILD OF TANAVAST. CHILD OF HONOR. CHILD OF ONE LONG SINCE DEPARTED. THE OATHPACT WAS SHATTERED. MEN RIDE THE STORMS NO LONGER. THE OATHPACT IS BROKEN, CHILD OF HONOR." - A voice of thunder, spoken to Kaladin during a Highstorm induced fever dream.

Bonded to [[Syl]].



A [[Knights Radiant]]. A Windrunner.
