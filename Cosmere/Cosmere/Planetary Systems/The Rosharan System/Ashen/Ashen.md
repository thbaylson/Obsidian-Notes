The Burning Planet. Suffered a cataclysm long ago. There are "famous, floating cities."

#Theorycraft 
[[Urithiru]] is a floating city and we know humans travelled to [[Cosmere/Planetary Systems/The Rosharan System/Roshar/Roshar]] from another world. It seems possible that humans in [[The Rosharan System]] are only native to Ashen.

Could this be where [[The Heralds]] go between [[Desolation]]s? How did [[Talenel]] escape?
