Creatures created by [[Rashek]]. They have a kind of fail safe mechanism whereby they can be controlled by a [[Soother]]. Kandra can consume the bones of a creature in order to take their form. Because of this ability, they serve as excellent assassins and spies. Each Kandra has at least two Hemalurgic ([[Hemalurgy]]) spikes which give them a blessing as well as sentience. A Kandra without those spikes, would simply be a [[Mistwraith]].

Notable Kandra:
[[OreSeur]]
[[TenSoon]]

"The Gods of the Kandra people":
