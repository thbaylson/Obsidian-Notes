Vin was born as a [[Skaa]]. Joined Kelsier's crew. Fell in love with Elend. Killed [[Rashek]]. Toppled the [[Final Empire]]. Killed [[Zane Venture]]. Released [[Ruin]] at the [[Well of Ascension]]. Believed to be [[The Hero of Ages]]. Succeeded [[Preservation]]. Destroyed the mind of [[Ruin]].

Why did Ruin choose Vin? It sounded like he invaded Vin's Mother's mind in order to give Vin the earring that would eventually let him influence her.
