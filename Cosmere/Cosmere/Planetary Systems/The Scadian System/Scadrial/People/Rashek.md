Originally from [[Terris]]. Rashek was the nephew of [[Kwaan]], a Worldbringer. He was tasked with misleading, discouraging, killing, or otherwise preventing [[Alendi]] from reaching the [[Well of Ascension]]. He succeeded in his quest and "took the power for himself." In doing so, he did not give up the power to [[Ruin]].

After attempting and failing to defeat [[Ruin]], Rashek founded [[Luthadel]] and became the Lord Ruler.

Using the power from the [[Well of Ascension]], he created the [[Kandra]] and the [[Koloss]]. He also founded the Steel Ministry and created its [[Inquisitors]].
