A [[Keeper]] of [[Terris]]. He is the product of [[Rashek]]'s Terrisman breeding program, an initiative meant to breed [[Feruchemy]] out of the population.

His focus as a Keeper is in religion. Because of this, he has learned the beliefs and philosophies of hundreds of religions. Like all Keepers, this information is stored in his [[Metalmind]]s.

Sazed joins [[Kelsier]]'s crew and assists in brining down the [[Final Empire]]. Throughout the story, he serves as a teacher for [[Vin]].

He learns about [[Ruin]]'s tampering of history. This coupled with the loss of his beloved, [[Tindwyl]], causes Sazed to eventually give up on his faith in the world's religions.


At the end of "The Hero of Ages", Sazed becomes [[The Hero of Ages]]. He takes the powers of both [[Preservation]] and [[Ruin]] in order to reshape the world. Using the centuries worth of information in the metalminds he keeps on his arms, he was able to restore the world to how it was before Rashek messed everything up.
