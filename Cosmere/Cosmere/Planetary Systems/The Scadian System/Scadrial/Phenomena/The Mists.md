## Pre collapse of the [[Final Empire]]
The [[Skaa]] have superstitious around the Mist. To them, it is something to be feared.



## Post collapse of the [[Final Empire]]
After the defeat of [[Rashek]], the Mists started killing people.

"People reported feeling a sentient hatred in the Mists."

"Those it favored, it swirled around. Those it was hostile to, it pulled away from."
* During [[Vin]]'s final confrontation with [[Zane Venture]], she described the Mist as pulling away from him.

## Notes
[[Alendi]] saw some sort of spirit in the Mists. Much later, [[Vin]] also saw some sort of spirit in the Mists. 

At the end of "The Hero of Ages" we learn that the mist spirit was one of the last remnants of [[Preservation]].
