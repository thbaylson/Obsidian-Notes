## History
Not much is known about the history of the world before [[Rashek]] ascended. We learn that most of the world's religions were wiped out by the Lord Ruler during his reign. 

The story begins within the [[Final Empire]]. The population is split between the ruling class [[Nobles]] and the working class [[Skaa]]. The capital is [[Luthadel]]. Once ruled by the Lord Ruler, [[Rashek]]. 

After [[Kelsier]] and his crew overthrew the Lord Ruler, [[Elend Venture]] rose to power.
