A form of [[Investiture]].

One of the 3 Metal Arts practiced on [[Scadrial]]. Allomancy is the utilization of specific [[Allomantic Metals]]. These metals, once ingested and *burned*, give allomancers powerful abilities. There are 16 allomantic metals. Individuals who can burn just one metal are called [[Misting]]s. Individuals who can burn all of the metals are called [[Mistborn]]. There is no in between. Except that one time Ruin gave Spook the ability to burn Pewter when he was previously just a Tineye.
