Dead gods of [[Hallandren]]. There are 24 in total. Each one has a color pair associated with them - a hue and a metal. For example, Lightsong's color pair is Red and Gold.

Known Returned:
* Warbreaker/Peacebringer
	* Presumed to be deseaced, we later learn that he went into hiding and donned the name [[Vasher]].
* [[Susebron]]
* [[Lightsong]]
* [[Blushweaver]]
* Allmother
* Hopefinder
* Mercystar

The returned were originally ordinary people. Ordinary people who died and inexplicably returned to the living. They are reborn with a single deific [[Breath]]. Their life energy is sustained by breaths, so they must be given at least one breath a week in order to not involuntarily consume their deific breath and kill themselves.

#Theorycraft 
The identifying attributes of each of the gods is a lie. They behavior is often opposite to their titles. 
* Lightsong, The Bold - Is afraid of war and insecure about himself. 
* Blushweaver, The Honest - Lies and tries to manipulate the people around her.
* Warbreaker/Peacebringer - Inadvertently started [[The Manywar]].
