A form of [[Investiture]].

Awakening, the art of using Breath/BioChroma.
* Using Breath has some visual parallels to using Stormlight - a kind of gas escapes from the users lips.

Breath can only be passed from one individual to another by speaking the words "My Life to yours. My Breath become yours."

If an individual doesn't have a single breath, they are a Drab.
