Ruled by King [[Dedelin]], Idris is a modest nation of a modest people. It sits among the highlands - giving it a colder climate for most of the year. It is viewed as rebellious by [[Hallandren]].

The royal family of Idris share a peculiar power, the Royal Locks. Their hair changes color according to strong emotions. This ability to change their looks comes from having Returned blood in their bloodline.
* Blonde/yellow for joy
* Red for anger, embarrassment, or arousal
* White for fear
If their hair is cut, the severed pieces will remain whatever color they were at the time they were cut off.

For a society that prides itself on modesty, drawing attention to one's emotions is seen as shameful. Thus, the royal family strives to keep their emotions under control and hair black. [[Vivenna]] is notably excellent at doing this while [[Siri]] has no ability to do so whatsoever.

Idrians still worship [[Austre]] and regard the [[T'Telir]] people as blasphemers.
