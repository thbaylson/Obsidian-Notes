"The terror of [[Hallandren]], the monster that had never drawn a living breath."

Actually, he's kind of a baby. Sheltered for all of his unlife - he is merely a figurehead for [[Hallandren]].

He holds within him thousands of [[Breath]]s. This puts him in a Heightening above anyone else. His Aura is far larger and more potent than anyone else's. Objects that are white have a prism, color-bending halo around them when they're in his Aura.

He sees color in a very different way than normal people. He describes to Siri that he can't focus on "small details" like what someone's face looks like. Instead, he sees all of the perfect colors, hues, tones, gradients, and patterns that make up the totality of a person.
