Lightsong, The Bold. One of [[The Returned]]. God of Bravery. His colors are Red and Gold.
His head priest is [[Llarimar]], but Lightsong calls him "Scoot."

He is haunted by dreams of war. A woman holding a black sword. A red panther. A tempest. Idrians and Halladren dying on a battlefield.

We eventually learn that he was a scribe before he died. He was also LLarimar's best friend. He died saving Llarimar's daughter from drowning. As a Returned, he gave his life a second time to heal [[Susebron]].
